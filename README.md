# Predicting College Football Recruits Using Machine Learning Techniques
### Goals: 
Build a supervised learning model to predict whether a high school recruit will commit to a school in one of the Power Five Conferences. Such a model could allow a school to optimize its recruiting process, maximizing its return on investment. This project trained on a dataset with 15 predictors (5 categorical and 10 continuous), consisting of an unprecedented combination of player-specific physical, performance, and geographical attributes.

### Outcomes:
The Random Forest model produced the best results when applied to the testing set, as it splits observations using only the most influential predictor from a subset of the predictors for each internal node and decorrelates its produced trees. The final model produced the lowest MSE and highest model accuracy percentage of 0.1109 and 84.90%, respectively. This model revealed which particular attributes are indisputably the most statistically significant predictors of commitment to a Power Five school.
